Here's a detailed plan for a **frontend-only website** that utilizes **localStorage** for data persistence and client-side computation to estimate missing precipitation data using methods like Arithmetic Mean, Normal Ratio, Inverse Distance Weighting, Isohyetal Method, and Theissen Polygon. The website will allow users to perform calculations either by dropping pins on an interactive map or by entering hypothetical coordinates.

---

### **Website Structure and Features**

#### **Technology Stack**
- **Frontend**: React, Tailwind CSS, leaflet.js (map functionality), D3.js/Chart.js (visualization)
- **Data Handling**: JavaScript (localStorage for persistence)
- **Geospatial Calculations**: turf.js (for distance and polygon calculations)

---

### **Website Features**

#### **1. Landing Page**
- **Purpose**: Introduce the website and its functionalities.
- **Content**:
  - Description of precipitation estimation methods.
  - Option to start analyzing or learn more about the methods.
  - Links to a "Documentation" page and a "Tools" page.

#### **2. Data Upload/Entry Page**
- Allow users to:
  1. Upload CSV files containing rainfall data with coordinates.
  2. Enter rainfall data manually (coordinates, precipitation values, and station names).

#### **3. Interactive Map (Main Tool)**
- **Core Functionality**:
  1. **Dropping Pins on Map**: 
     - Users can drop pins to represent stations.
     - Enter precipitation data for each pin.
  2. **Hypothetical Coordinates**:
     - Users can input coordinates directly (relative to a base point or absolute lat-long).
- Display the station data dynamically on the map.

#### **4. Methods Page**
- Dropdown or sidebar with all available methods:
  - **Arithmetic Mean**
  - **Normal Ratio**
  - **Inverse Distance Weighting**
  - **Isohyetal Method**
  - **Theissen Polygon**
- Users can select a method, specify inputs, and view results directly on the map or through charts.

#### **5. Results Page**
- **Visualization**:
  - Show graphs (e.g., rainfall hyetographs, cumulative rainfall mass curves).
  - Interactive map updates with results (e.g., Isohyets or polygons).
- Allow users to download results as a CSV file.

#### **6. Data Storage**
- Use **localStorage** to:
  - Save user-uploaded or entered data.
  - Store map pins and calculations persistently within the browser.

### **Detailed Implementation for Each Method**

#### **1. Arithmetic Mean**
- **Formula**:  
  \[
  P_{\text{missing}} = \frac{\sum_{j=1}^{N} P_j}{N}
  \]
  where \(P_j\) is precipitation at the \(j\)-th station, and \(N\) is the total number of stations.
- **UI Workflow**:
  1. User drops pins or enters coordinates with rainfall values.
  2. The missing station is marked on the map or entered manually.
  3. Calculate the mean using data from the neighboring stations.
- **Visualization**:
  - Highlight the missing station and display the estimated value.

---

#### **2. Normal Ratio Method**
- **Formula**:
  \[
  P_{\text{missing}} = \frac{\sum_{j=1}^{N} \left(P_j \cdot \frac{P_{\text{normal,missing}}}{P_{\text{normal},j}}\right)}{N}
  \]
  - \(P_{\text{normal,missing}}\): Normal precipitation at the missing station.
  - \(P_{\text{normal},j}\): Normal precipitation at the \(j\)-th station.
- **UI Workflow**:
  1. User provides normal precipitation values for all stations.
  2. Enter missing station coordinates manually or select on map.
  3. Display estimated precipitation.
- **Visualization**:
  - Show the normal ratio weights for each station.

---

#### **3. Inverse Distance Weighting**
- **Formula**:
  \[
  P_{\text{missing}} = \frac{\sum_{j=1}^{N} \frac{P_j}{d_j}}{\sum_{j=1}^{N} \frac{1}{d_j}}
  \]
  - \(P_j\): Precipitation at the \(j\)-th station.
  - \(d_j\): Distance of the \(j\)-th station from the missing station.
- **UI Workflow**:
  1. Users mark stations on the map or input their coordinates.
  2. Specify the location of the missing station.
  3. Use turf.js to compute distances between the missing station and all others.
- **Visualization**:
  - Display distance-weighted values as a heatmap around the missing station.

---

#### **4. Isohyetal Method**
- **Workflow**:
  1. Allow users to draw isohyets (lines of equal rainfall) on the map.
  2. Calculate the area between two consecutive isohyets.
  3. Assign weights based on areas and compute rainfall using:
     \[
     P = \frac{\sum_{j=1}^{N} \text{Area}_j \cdot \text{Average Rainfall in Area}_j}{\text{Total Area}}
     \]
- **UI Workflow**:
  - Drag to create isohyets interactively on the map.
  - Calculate weighted averages based on drawn areas.
- **Visualization**:
  - Show isohyetal regions with color gradients.

---

#### **5. Theissen Polygon Method**
- **Workflow**:
  1. Users drop pins on the map to represent stations.
  2. Dynamically generate Theissen polygons using turf.js.
  3. Assign rainfall values to each polygon and calculate the area-weighted average.
- **UI Workflow**:
  - Automatically draw Theissen polygons when new pins are added.
  - Allow users to edit polygon boundaries if necessary.
- **Visualization**:
  - Display polygons with precipitation values overlaid.

---

### **Data Flow and Interaction**
1. **User Input**:
   - Users upload data, drop pins, or enter coordinates.
2. **Processing**:
   - Perform calculations for selected methods using JavaScript libraries.
3. **Visualization**:
   - Use Chart.js/D3.js for graphs and leaflet.js for interactive maps.
4. **Storage**:
   - Save inputs and outputs in localStorage for persistent use.

---

### **Tools and Libraries**
- **React**: Build dynamic user interfaces.
- **Tailwind CSS**: Styling the application.
- **leaflet.js**: Map functionality (pin dropping, isohyets, polygons).
- **turf.js**: Geospatial calculations (distances, polygons).
- **D3.js/Chart.js**: Data visualization (graphs and charts).
- **localStorage**: Data persistence in the browser.

---

### **Next Steps**
- **Development**:
  - Start with the map and pin-dropping functionality.
  - Implement individual methods step-by-step.
- **Testing**:
  - Use sample precipitation datasets to verify calculations.
- **Deployment**:
  - Host the website on a platform like Vercel or Netlify.
